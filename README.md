# clothing-fun

This is a website that I created using HTML/CSS/jQuery after looking at the j-crew website. I wondered if I could make something like this,
if someone told me to. Creating this site helped me brush up on my fundamentals as well as taught me new ways to code.

I still have to work on it some more, such as adding dropdown buttons, but given that there are no real other links, all of the a href tags link to nothing.
Additionally, I wish I had better images, in terms of resolution and size, especially in the middle section, where the loafer and clothing rack pictures are located.
